# EE_473_Part_2_Calculations
This is just a documentation of my MATLAB code for EE 473

This was done by importing the .mat files from AWR using this guide:
https://awrcorp.com/download/faq/english/docs/Users_Guide/output_files.html

Additionally, I used Arrays to calculate dynamically how much values I export from AWR (MicroWave Office).

Enjoy if you find this and I'm done with school already (LOL).
